# Tool-Condition-Prediction-with-CNTK
Using Neural Networks and supervised learning, CNTK (Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit), learning C#


There are a couple of Aux functions in engine/myCNTK.cs that convert .csv files to CNTK supported format

I also use Math.NET library to pre-process data for NN input

Will clean this up at some point
